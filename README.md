# Feldunor
A roguelike and reboot of the deprecated "RudiE" project.

A simple roguelike game made from scratch in C++. It is an amateur project with the purpose of creating a compelling and fun game akin to the classic game Rogue. This is the reboot of the "RudiE" project that I began last year but did not finish. It is being built mostly from the ground up with a more careful approach, including more planning and not just slapping stuff on. Additions and alterations will continue to be made as I gain more experience.

The game is currently a work in progress and does not work yet.
