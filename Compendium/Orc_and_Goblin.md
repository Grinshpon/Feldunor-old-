# The Orc

Orcs are a tough brutes. Their skin is thick and colors range from a dark green to a muddy brown. They are the most intelligent of the ungifted races, and they are natural warmongers. Many Orc tribes are nomadic, while many others have settled. Some have even gone underground, to the annoyance of the Dwarves.

Orcs have a rigid caste system, made to ensure that each individual contributes meaningfully to the tribe. In every generation of Orcs, the strongest become Grunts, a strong warrior class. They form the armies, the guards, and they are merciless. The wisest become Sages. Sages can be royal advisers, and historians, but are mainly seekers of dark magics that can enhance their tribe's ferocity. The 
weakest are to become the lowly servant Peons. As such, Peons are weak creatures, and years 
of abuse and submissiveness have rendered them cowardly. When they sustain significant 
damage or hear the cries around them, they are sure to run away.

## The Goblin

Goblins and Orcs are the same race, but a Goblins is a much tinier, frailer creature, considered to be the lowest within the Orc caste. Although separate Goblin tribes exist, they are mainly slaves to their superior Orcs. There is still a distinction between an Orc Peon and a Goblin, however many consider them to be on equal footing, and equally undeserving of respect.
