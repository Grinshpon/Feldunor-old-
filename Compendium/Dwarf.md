# The Dwarf

Dwarves are typically short and muscular, making them ideal miners and durable warriors. They prefer carving tunnels and building atop hills and mountains to create dwelling areas and great halls, while simultaneously earing vast amounts of minerals and resources, making Dwarves very wealthy material-wise. They do not exclusively live in mountains, despite myths, for that wouldn't be practical, and building all their cities entirely underground exclusively would take much too long. They do, however, know the underground better than any greater race (they do compete with certain types of goblins and orcs).

Dwarves are a rigid and conservative people. Even their language has seen little evolution beyond the initial stages, with the exception of additions to describe new inventions and ideas. They are a practical race and tend to speak literally. They also tend to designate objects and people by their most common or recognizable trait, hence a popular surname is the color or unique feature of one's beard.

Dwarves speak in consonants, and syllables mostly take the form of modifiers. The shape of the letters are mostly angular and sharp because it is quicker and easier to etch these runes into stone.
