# The Elf

Elves are quite tall, and while they can be physically very strong, appear to be relatively skinny. Elves are a spiritual people, and prefer to live among greenery, in the woodlands. They are ponders, and like to express thought in metaphors or poems. They are also the most magically gifted of the higher races.

Unlike the Dwarven tongue, Elves speak mostly in syllables. Because Elves prefer to pass on their stories and language vocally, there was no unified elven alphabet nor is there a central dialect. Rather, it was regional. As such, many attempts from the outside to map their alphabet has been met with difficulty. However, the War between Dwarves and Elves (or War between Elves and Dwarves) created a need for one unified tongue, and Elf scholars set forth on the task to study and discern all dialects to come up with a common alphabet and grammatical structure. Since then, many local Elf communities merged with the growing empires and nations.
