# The Blood Elf
Because Elves are naturally gifted with magic, they are also the race most vulnerable to magical corruption. Blood Elves are a caste of Elves that have been cast out for practicing dark and forbidden magics, and over time they have become corrupted. They abandoned the natural deities and instead worship Demons, chaotic spirits that feed off magic.

# The Demon
The Demon Spirits are kin to several of the old gods. While an otherwordly spirit cannot create a physical body on its own, it can manifest itself within a host, and take control of it. The best host is one that is naturally magically adept, and the most succepting hosts are the ones that are willing and eager to be taken. Thus, Blood Elves are the perfect match to transform into Demon bodies. Much of the work has already been done. A successfull procedure is not a guarantee however. Botched but still functional results are known as Imps, they are smaller, weaker, and more deformed. A succesfull Demon body is larger, stronger, and cunning.
